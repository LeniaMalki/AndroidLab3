--> The preference class ic called via the onOptionsItemSelected() method whenever the button is
pressed. A intent is then used to start the activity as follows:
Intent i = new Intent(this, Preferences.class);

• You may be notified that user credentials are not actually reset and that the notification is
not received. How can this be done in the code?
--> You can send out a message
Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Reset user name and password", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();

  o Explain how to redesign the app to work with fragment
• Update the app icon, use any icon of your choice (see your notification icon change as well)
• Give example of applications where such preferences are useful?
